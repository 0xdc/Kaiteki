# Code of Conduct

## Core Principles

- Don't be a dick to others
- We don't care what your background is (with exceptions, see point above)
- We reserve the right to refuse support and fallback to the "software as-is" clause, as stated in [our license](LICENSE).
- We reserve the right to moderate at our own discretion.

## In detail

We won't allow trolling, harassing, or any derailing of our intentions towards the project.

We won't exclude anyone from contributing, unless...
1. Your contribution is objectively bad or requires too much work to patch it up to be acceptable.
2. Your contribution is too niche or doesn't follow our direction of the project.
3. Your contribution either is with malicious intent or supports harassment or communities that do.
