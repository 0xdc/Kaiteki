# Kaiteki
A Fediverse client for micro-blogging instances written in Flutter/Dart.

This repository contains no code until the code that is being worked on reaches a usable state. From that point I'll accept contributors to work on the project.

Currently there is support planned for Pleroma, Mastodon and Misskey, where Pleroma gets priority over implementation.

### Working with API responses
For this project, I created a [C# script](https://gist.github.com/Craftplacer/3151b64ab86ee929202eab8173e8a7fe) for generating Dart classes for working with deserialized JSON (as Flutter itself does not allow reflection).

If you know anything to improve this process, please let me know.
